## Learning Goals

The goals of this project included furthering our understanding of working with APIs and fetched data. We also extended our project to include deployment as well as a carousel. Utilizing React was emphasized throughout as well as Cypress testing.

## Personal Reflections

During this project, we encountered a few unexpected struggles. When fetching API data, it became necessary to rethink our original MVP design.

## Project Evolution

It was quickly recognized upon beginning this project that its evolution would become a continual necessity. Our original MVP design changed throughout when the need arose. Whether this need came from encountering React-specific quirks or quirks of the data itself, our responsiveness allowed us to adapt and fulfill our new MVP vision.

## Future Improvements

In the future, we would like to add movie details to the featured movies' trailer carousel. We would also like to add ratings that responsively indicate the average score to make it easy to compare amongst viewers. We would also like to give users functionality to sort movie both by genre and alphabetically.
