## Learning Goals

The goals of this project included furthering our understanding of working with APIs and fetched data. We also extended our project to include deployment as well as a carousel. Utilizing React was emphasized throughout as well as Cypress testing.

## Personal Reflections

During this project, we encountered a few unexpected struggles. When fetching API data, it became necessary to rethink our original MVP design.

## Project Evolution

It was quickly recognized upon beginning this project that its evolution would become a continual necessity. Our original MVP design changed throughout when the need arose. Whether this need came from encountering React-specific quirks or quirks of the data itself, our responsiveness allowed us to adapt and fulfill our new MVP vision.
